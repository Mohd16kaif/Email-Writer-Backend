## How It Works

1. The frontend sends the user's email content (email thread or last received email) to the backend.
2. The backend processes the request and forwards the email context to Google Gemini API.
3. The Gemini API generates a relevant and concise reply.
4. The backend returns the AI-generated reply as a JSON response.
